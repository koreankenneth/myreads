# MyReads Project

MyReads is a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. Youâ€™ll search for books and add them to a bookshelf. 

## How it works

This project has these functionalities below:

* reading organizer
* tracker
* shelves
* search

## Technologies I've used here

* Nodejs
* Reactjs
* create-react-app
* React Router
* prop-types
* Bootstrap
* Udacity API

## Udacity API

To simplify the development process, Udacity provides a backend server. The file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
